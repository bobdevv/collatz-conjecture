# Collatz Conjecture Visualizer

This Python script visualizes the Collatz Conjecture sequence for any positive integer. It uses `tkinter` for the graphical interface to display bubbles connected by arrows and provides a zoomable, pannable canvas. A chart of the sequence is also displayed after the animation.

## Features

- Animated visualization of the Collatz sequence with numbered bubbles.
- Arrows show the transitions between numbers.
- Zoom in and out for better viewing.
- Panning functionality to navigate the canvas.
- Generates a chart of the sequence after visualization.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- `tkinter` (comes pre-installed with Python)
- `matplotlib` (install using `pip install matplotlib`)
